I'd love to don't but small step by small step, I'm adopting ways of writing code in python and not only by copy/paste so I love to tell you how I see a **nice cool** way of writing the most readable code ever.

```python
"""
    Header with the title summary of the python's script.

    List of references I can be sure you've copy paste some code please give the link.

    Let's have a look there to be inspire
    https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

    Let say thanks to all the participants ;)

    That's All folks!
"""
```

Aim of **guidelines** is make code readable fastiest as possible. 

When you wrote spcifications you will have some steps to cut your program in small steps. You can retreive this in your comments like numbering the steps.

In python syntaxe is done by indentation so let's talking about comment :

```python
# -----------------
# 1. First Big Step
# -----------------
# the resume of this big step and a '#" to separate the end of this comment
# from the code yes it's really more readable
#
tab_in_python []
```

Has there is no resume you can glue de code with the end of step's header.

```python
# ------------------
# 2. Second Big Step
# ------------------
tab_in_python []
```

Small step under Step 2

```python
# 2.1 Small step into step 2
#
tab_in_python []
```

Here again you separate the step header from the code by a caracter '#"

```python
# Then a very small step
```

Next time i will told you about paranthesis ...
